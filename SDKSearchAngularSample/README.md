Starting the demo
-----------------

Before running any of the files mentioned below, run `npm install` in the root folder. That will install the latest version of Rainbow Web SDK along with the basic http-server.

Once this is done, update the `appId` and `appSecret` variables in `src/js/sdkSampleApp.js` file. If you don't know where can you get your Application ID and Application Secret from, check our [guide](https://hub.openrainbow.com/#/documentation/doc/sdk/web/guides/Adding_id_and_secret_key).

Then, depending on your operating system, run the following command in the root folder:
- Linux/MacOS: `npm run start`
- Windows: `npm run start-win`

At the end, open your browser on `http://localhost:8887/ .
