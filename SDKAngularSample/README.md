# Rainbow SDK for Web

Preamble
--------
The Rainbow SDK (Software Development Kit) for Web is a JavaScript library that works on all modern browsers from IE 11 to the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. Its powerful APIs enable you to create the best applications that connect to the Rainbow Cloud Services.

This demo is provided "as is" without support.

The demo demonstrates the use of the following Rainbow SDK for Web APIs:

- Connection Service: The demo shows how to use these APIs to connect to Rainbow

- Contacts and Presence Services: Using these services, the demo shows how to retrieve the informations from the contacts and how to change the presence state of the connected user

- Conversation and IM Services: These APIs are used in the demo to display or create a conversation with a contact and to send and receive Instant Messages with them.

Starting the demo
-----------------

Before running any of the files mentioned below, run `npm install` in the root folder. That will install the latest version of Rainbow Web SDK along with the basic http-server.

Once this is done, update the `appId` and `appSecret` variables in `src/js/sdkSampleApp.js` file. If you don't know where can you get your Application ID and Application Secret from, check our [guide](https://hub.openrainbow.com/#/documentation/doc/sdk/web/guides/Adding_id_and_secret_key).

Then, depending on your operating system, run the following command in the root folder:
- Linux/MacOS: `npm run start`
- Windows: `npm run start-win`

At the end, open your browser on `http://localhost:8887/ .
